This is a code to estimate the baryonic fraction within an NFW halo using a simple analytic model. 
It also provides a M_{1/2} at which the baryonic fraction equals to half of the cosmic mean value. 
This code enables readers to calculate with different halo concentrations, redshifts and cosmologies.
Our comparison with simulations shows that it usually underestimates M_{1/2} by a factor of 1-2.
